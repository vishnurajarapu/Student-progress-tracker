# 🎓 Student Progress Tracker System (Python)

The **Student Progress Tracker System** is a **menu-driven, console-based Python application** that allows users to enter student details, record subject marks, calculate results, and generate a detailed progress report.

This project is designed for **beginners** to practice **core Python concepts** commonly asked in exams and mini-projects.

## 📌 Features
- Student detail input (Name, Class, Roll Number)
- Dynamic subject mark entry
- Total and average calculation
- Grade calculation
- Pass / Fail decision
- Menu-driven (Do-While style using `while True`)
- View report without re-entering data

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Variables & Data Types
- User Input (`input()`)
- Arithmetic Operations
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- List operations
- `any()` function
- f-string formatting

## 🧮 Grading Logic
| Average Marks | Grade |
|--------------|-------|
| ≥ 90         | A     |
| ≥ 75         | B     |
| ≥ 50         | C     |
| ≥ 35         | D     |
| < 35         | Fail  |

A student is marked **FAIL** if **any subject mark is less than 35**.
